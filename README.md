# Advanced Regression Assignment
> ### Problem Statement:
Surprise housing is a US based housing company. The company's model is to purchase the houses below their actual price and sell them at hiher price. The company is entering in Australian market and wants to study the market. The company has collected the data of sale of houses in Australia.

> ### Requirement:
The company want t build a reression model usin regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties to decide whether to invest or not. Secondly they also want to know which variables are sinificant to predict the price and how well these variables describe the price of the house. As analyst we are require to determine the optimal value of lambda.

> ### Approach:
- Step 1: Understanding the date, Data Preperation & EDA
- Step 2: Model building and evaluation with both ridge and lasso regression methods. Finding optimal alpha. Evaluating changes in the predictor variables due to the change in alpha. Explaining the rationale for choosing the model
- Step 3: Rebuild the model without top 5 predictor variables as asked in the assignment
- Step 4: Explaning the rationale for making the model robust and generalized
